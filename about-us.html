					States.
				</p>

				<h2>Geology</h2>

				<p>The Glass Mountain pumice deposit is located in the Medicine Lake Highlands, Tionesta, CA, high above the Klamath Basin,
					which is a topographically high region of recent volcanic terrain. The Medicine Lake Highlands is a shield volcano along
					the boundary between the Cascade Range to the west and the Modoc Plateau to the east. A caldera, approximately six miles
					across at its widest diameter, occupies the top of the broad shield volcano. Medicine Lake is within this caldera.</p>

				<p>The Medicine Lake Highlands is one of four active volcanic regions in California. There are more than 100 volcanic vents
					on the flanks of the shield volcano, most of which are either silica domes or cinder cones with associated lava flows.
					There have been at least six documented eruptions in the past 2,000 years.</p>

				<p>The pumice is less than 23,000 years old. The old trees found in the pumice and obviously killed by the pumice eruptions
					to be between 1,400 to 1,700 years old. The pumice erupted from vents close by, from the Glass Mountain area which is
					within one mile south of the mine. The thickest depth of the pumice is found to the south indicating the origin may
					be in that direction. Subsequent to the pumice emplacement, silica viscous glass flows come from vents on Glass Mountain,
					forming massive blocky flows of rhyolite, obsidian and rhyolite dacite. These flows terminate in the steep slopes along
					the southern margins of the claims where the pumice exposures terminate.</p>

				<p>The pumice is an air-fall unit. It attains a thickness of up to 40' on the claim, where it is closest to the vent, down
					to less than three feet in thickness further away from the vent. The pumice is light grayish-white and ranges in size
					from blocks of several inches across to fines. The original terrain is blanketed by the pumice.</p>
